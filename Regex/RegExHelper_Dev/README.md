# RegExHelper
A UI to help with writing Regular Expressions.

This is a UI built using PowerShell and WPF that allows for simple Regular Expression checking by displaying the results in real time.

Currently this only supports a string match but future versions will allow for locating patterns in a log file or similiar groups of text.

Feedback and improvements are always welcome! This is the Dev branch where I would like to improve performance on the log RegEx portion (2nd tab). Currently the 2nd tab is not working properly (this is Dev of course :) ) due to something I did between now and when I started troubleshooting the performance issue. It's also worth noting that my goal is to have the matching items from the RegEx highlighted in the window that the text is at to show the effectiveness of the pattern.
